##Liber Potatica

The Liber Potatica is a fan-altered version of the Horus Heresy 2.0 ruleset, incorporating certain elements from Horus Heresy 3.0 and updating old ones from 2.0 and 1.0. The folders above contain files for the current version of Liber Potatica (v0.0.2) which is currently very much under development. A "stable" version of the game will be available to play at v0.1 for the legions DA, SW, WE, SoH and BA.
